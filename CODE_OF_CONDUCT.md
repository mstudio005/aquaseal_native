# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our
  mistakes, and learning from the experience

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language
- Discriminatory or derogatory comments
- Harassment or unwelcome attention

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our
standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem
unacceptable, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
be reported by contacting the project team at the repository issue
tracker or by email (see `SECURITY.md`). All complaints will be
reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
