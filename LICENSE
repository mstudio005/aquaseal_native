GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
 any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
 your programs, too.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
 freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
 or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.

 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
 software.

 For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.

 Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
 can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
 protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
 pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
 use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, the
 GPL assures that users of a covered work can change the covered work,
 and that producers of modified versions must provide the same
 freedoms to the recipients.

 Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
 make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.


TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
if it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License,
and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a
user to accept a license agreement or similar, the interface must
prominently display the Appropriate Legal Notices.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of
a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep
intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy
of this License along with the Program.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

 a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

 b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

 c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
    to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License
    will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

 a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

 b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    distribution, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from
    a network server at no charge.

 c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

 d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place ("Internet server" or similar) and offer equivalent access
    to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
    place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients to
    copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the
    place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding
    Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
    party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
    maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to
    find the Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts
    the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it
    is available for as long as necessary to satisfy these
    requirements.

 e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this License, for material
you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
terms:

 a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

 b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

 c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

 d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

 e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

 f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions
    of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,
    for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly
    impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license, provided that the further restriction does not apply
to the whole of the combined work.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work done
by conveying it to the public (for example, publishing on a publicly
accessible server) does require acceptance of this License to the
extent set forth in section 8.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use of the
Program under this License.  The work thus licensed is called the
contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's essential patent claims are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do
not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this
definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in
a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(or part of a patent) against you or your downstream recipients under
certain conditions.  Such a patent license is "discriminatory" if it
does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the
exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of
the rights that are specifically granted under this License.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
your distribution of the object code is expressly made subject to the
patent license terms offered by the contributor, and you must make a
reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain such source code or
ensure that the source code is available; otherwise, you may not
convey the object code.

If, in order to make, use, or sell the Program, you rely upon a patent
license, and the patent license is not available for anyone to copy,
free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly
available network server or other readily accessible means, you must
make a reasonably prompt effort to ensure that no discriminatory
patent license applies to the Program; otherwise, you may not convey
the Program.

If you convey a covered work, and you grant a patent license to some
of the parties receiving the covered work, then the patent license you
grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work
and applies to the corresponding source of the covered work.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that
oblige you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to
whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both your
obligations would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version
published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSS
OF BUSINESS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.


END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
