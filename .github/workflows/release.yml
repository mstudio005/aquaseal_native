# NOTE: This workflow creates a release object on GitHub when a tag is pushed.
# To build and upload APK artifacts you can extend this job to install the
# Android SDK, build with Gradle and then upload artifacts with
# actions/upload-release-asset. Building Android in CI requires additional
# configuration (Android SDK, signing keys, sufficient memory).
