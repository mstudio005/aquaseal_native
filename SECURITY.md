# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public
issue. Instead, contact the maintainers privately so we can investigate
and remediate before public disclosure.

Report a vulnerability

- Email: maintainer@local (replace with your preferred contact)
- If you prefer encrypted communication, include a PGP key in the
  message.

Response

We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and provide a
timeline for remediation. Once a fix is available, we will coordinate
public disclosure and provide credit as appropriate.

Note

This repository currently does not have a dedicated security team. If
you need a quicker response, please open an issue and mark it
"security" but avoid posting exploit details publicly.
